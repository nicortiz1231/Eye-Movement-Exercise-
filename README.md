# Sharingan-Movement-Exercise

This is my version of the Eye Movement exercise from MIT xPro course. 

I wanted to put a spin on it so a referenced a character from the anime Naruto.

This project was very fun, wasn't anything too hard but definitley taught me a lot.

In the future will probably add different styles of eyes.
